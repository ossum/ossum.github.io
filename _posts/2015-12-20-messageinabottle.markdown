How often have you sent off a message in a bottle, only to realise, as it floats out of sight, that you regret the contents of your message? Well, with the Text Message in a Bottle (TM) that will no longer be a problem! You can update your message at any time, just by sending a text. Fantastic!

This was another silly little project, designed to inspire people to build solar-powered gsm-connected devices with the Mediatek Linkit One. Suprisingly it won a "runner up" prize in the Instructables "Brave the Elements" contest.
