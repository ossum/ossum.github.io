This project was definitely the most externsive CAD design that I have attempted so far, but the hours I put into it were well worth it. The laser-cut aluminium chassis and the 3D printed Nylon body went together perfectly, and have proven to be very durable.

The design iteslf was never meant to compete with high performance modern RC cars (which have a ridiculous power-to-weight ratios and ground-scraping center's of gravity), rather I wanted to replicate the driving style of the heavy old Tamiya buggies (like my beloved Super Champ).

Besides winning a grand prize in the Instructable's 3D printing competition, this project got a bit of attention around the web
