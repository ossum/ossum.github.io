I was chosen to receive an Intel Edison dev kit as part of an Instructables promotion. I created a light plotter that could draw images from an SVG into a long-exposure photo using an ESP8266 and an RGB LED dangling on a string between two stepper motors, with all the control handled by the Edison.

I was stoked to win a second prize in the Instructables "Intel IOT Invitational" with this project.
