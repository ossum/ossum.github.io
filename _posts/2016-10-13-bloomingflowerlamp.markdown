I have had my CraftBot+ that I won via Instructables for about 2 months now and have been reliably churning out a variety of simple designs, so I decided to challenge myself to build something that would be difficult without 3D printing. In the end I came up with a night light in the form of a flower, which blooms as it turns on, and am thoroughly pleased with the result, the CraftBot+ did a fantastic job of it.

You can find all of the files on [Thingiverse](www.thingiverse.com/thing:1805365) and all of the build instructions on [Instructables](www.instructables.com/id/Blooming-Marvelous-Flower-Lamp/)

This project was [featured on Hackaday](http://hackaday.com/2016/10/11/blooming-flower-lamp-will-test-your-3d-printer/) which is always nice.
