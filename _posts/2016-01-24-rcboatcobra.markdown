I came across some some horribly low-res old plans, in a language I don't understand, to build a radio-controlled boat that uses a gas airplane motor and propeller for propulsion. I didn't have a gas motor and had never built a boat, so naturally I couldn't get the project out of my head.

It has taken a lot of tweaking, but I think the boat is finally working well enough to share here.

The CAD files and build instructions are all available on [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Airscrew-Driven-RC-Boat/)
